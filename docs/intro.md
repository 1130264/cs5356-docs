Hey all,

Most of the content and resources for the class will be shared out through this site. I'll be updating this page as class goes on with useful links & shortcuts to relevant course content.

I'm using this site because some things are really hard to get formatted correctly in Canvas, and its easier to work with Git & Github to get this working.
