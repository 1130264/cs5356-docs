# Milestone 2 - Class Questions

## Problem

Its natural for students to have questions during class, but questions can come from a variety of places. Its helpful to have one place to go to ask a question - where other students & the instructor can view the questions/comments that come up during class.

## User Stories

* As a student, I can ask a question (with my name or anonymously) for a particular class
* As a student, I can view questions being asked for a particular class session
* As a student, I can upvote or downvote a question
* As an instructor, I can view questions (and upvotes) that students are asking for a particular class session
* As an instructor, I can view who asked a particular question
* As an instructor, I can dismiss a question
* As an instructor, I can view my classes & class sessions
* As an instructor, I can create a class session


## Questions to keep in mind

1. What use cases are missing from the wireframe? Hint: There are 6 user stories missing/incomplete from the wireframe.
2. What data will I need to support that feature?
