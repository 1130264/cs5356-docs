# Milestone 1

For Milestone 1, you'll work with "our client" - someone who wants you to build their page for them. You'll review the wireframes for the project, and the technical specs, and implement it according to the specs.

## Context

Our client is a veterinarian who wants to sell pet products to their patients/customers that are better quality than what you’ll find in stores.

As a way of starting up their business, they’re looking to get a website up and running that they can start sharing out to gauge interest in their products before building out something bigger.

## Requirements

The site will function as a landing page, where potential customers should be able to choose between 3 products available for pre-order. When they select one of these buttons, they should be taken to a checkout page where they should be able to pay with a credit card.

They’re expecting a big hit of traffic from this, and they need this to be fast & reliable. If a customer can’t access the site, they can’t place their order.

We’ll also need to provide them a dashboard where they can see the traffic to the website.

## Project Wireframes

You can review the Wireframe for this project over [here in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/H85eC9Nup1D780yoHIzlBh/CS-5356-Prototype-%231?node-id=77%3A432&t=zj0cQezJSSFpXMkL-1)

The provided wireframes provide a rough idea of what the site could look like. You are free to style it how you wish - as long as you get something that works.

## Technical Specs

1. This landing page will be set up as a Static Website, meaning its made up of just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It can all be in one file or in multiple files.
2. The products that will be listed on the page will be provided via a JSON file, and the landing page will display the products based on the data in that JSON file.
3. We'll deploy our landing page using Firebase Hosting, which lets us host this page for free for millions of requests.
4. All the metrics that we need to see about the website will be available in the Firebase Console.

## Notes about the Assignment

1. This assignment will be submitted via Github Classroom, so we can leave feedback on your code and you can leave your code private.
2. There are 2 parts to the Assignment Submission
  a. Part 1 - the project code which will go through Github Classroom & Canvas.
  b. Part 2 - the deployed website URL & screenshots of metrics & logs for your application. This will be submitted through Canvas.
